/**
 * navHelpers — workspace-aware navigation utilities.
 *
 * P1.20: bare `setActiveWorkspace(w)` calls outside the WorkspaceSwitcher
 * left the URL stuck on the OLD workspace id when the caller was on a
 * wid-scoped route (`/workspaces/<wid>/...` or `/admin/companies/<wid>/...`).
 * BillingTab / OverviewPage / SettingsPage kept showing the wrong company
 * because `wid` from useParams() wasn't re-routed.
 *
 * `switchTo` mirrors the helper baked into WorkspaceSwitcher.jsx so every
 * call site (CreateWorkspacePage, OnboardingWizard, AcceptInvitePage,
 * WorkspaceInvitesPanel, etc.) gets identical behaviour: set the workspace
 * active AND re-target the current route to the new id if the URL was
 * keyed by the old one. Callers who never sit on a wid-scoped route are
 * unharmed — the pathname regex simply doesn't match and we no-op the nav.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   import { makeSwitchTo } from '@/utils/navHelpers'
 *   const switchTo = makeSwitchTo({
 *     setActiveWorkspace,
 *     currentWorkspaceId: currentWorkspace?._id,
 *     navigate,
 *     location,
 *   })
 *   switchTo(newWorkspace)
 *
 * `navigate` and `location` come from react-router-dom's `useNavigate` and
 * `useLocation`.
